notebook complements the notebook `llm-prompting_potential-talents.ipynb` in the same folder, and explores an alternative way to prompt LLMs that does away with the computational issues shown therein. When manually loading pretrained LLMs and prompting them within the `transformer` package, I indeed encountered a number of errors both locally and remotely, that could only be solved by purchasing compute units in google colab. Here, I bypass the computational part of the workflow by relegating it to `langchain`.\n","\n","The notebook will have the same goal as the complement notebook.
